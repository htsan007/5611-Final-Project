For the final project I chose to do option 4, which was to implement a technique that was discussed in class and something I didnâ€™t already implement. I settled on an Eulerian smoke simulation with the aim of extending it to fire. We talked about Eulerian fluid in class, so there is a direct relation to my project topic. Eulerian fluid follows changes in flow over a single location in space and utilizes the Navier-Stokes equation to help calculate the flow of incompressible fluid (smoke and fire in my case). The state-of-the-art way to implement fire and smoke as fluid often includes volumetric fluid solvers, often using some form of the Navier-Stokes equation and treating the simulation space as a flow-grid. An example used by lots of research in fire-safety is the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), which uses a Large eddy simulation for turbulance using the Navier-Stokes equation, and a Smokeview (SMV) program used to display the fire and smoke. As seen in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0379711223001467"> Real-time visualization of smoke for fire safety engineering applications </a>  AND in <a href="https://history.siggraph.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2004-Poster-101-Barrero_CFD-and-Realistic-Visualization-for-the-Analysis-of-Fire-Scenarios.pdf"> Computation and Representation of Fire and Smoke in Buildings </a>. Here is the direct source for <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/"> FDS-SMV </a>. Another flow-grid solver example uses an efficient sparse fluid solver that skips inactive space where a traditional volumetric fluid solver does not, as seen from <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3388767.3407380"> Sparse Smoke Simulations in Houdini </a>.
